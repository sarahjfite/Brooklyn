To be honest, I've spent a week trying to figure out the pattern of these charts.  I can't.  I'm not sure if I messed up the assignment or if the data is supposed to look like this, but even with the work done to trim the outliers, the numbers are so astronomical on the plots that the scatter plots look like Rorschach tests.  The one bar chart only shows one bar because the data is of such extreme differences.  Again, I really can't draw any sort of meaningful conclusion from the charts.
